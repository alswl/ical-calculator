DESCRIPTION:Saturday in Keene: Defend Marriage Equality in NH\n\nCalling al
 l Marriage Equality Partners!\n \nThe Monadnock Live Free and Equal Coaliti
 on is co-hosting our region’s Camp Courage on Saturday\, January 22 at the 
 Keene Public Library from 9am-2pm!  Learn talking points\, be coached on ho
 w to tell your story\, and then actually tape your testimony between 2-4:00
 pm\, next door at the Cheshire TV studios in Heberton Hall!  Details below.
 \n \nGranite State Camp Courage\nA series of regional trainings hosted by G
 ranite State Progress\, in collaboration with the Courage Campaign\n\nYou a
 nd I know that New Hampshire is an equality state. New Hampshire passed mar
 riage equality in 2009\, soundly defeated a repeal effort in 2010 and sent 
 a clear message at town meeting last year that the Granite State opposes di
 scrimination.\n \nBut anti-equality forces are at work again in our state\,
  introducing legislation to overturn marriage equality and codify discrimin
 ation into our state law. Immediately\, we need to help ensure equality rem
 ains a proud Live Free or Die tradition in New Hampshire. In the long-term\
 , we need to build more visible\, broad public support for equality by chan
 ging the hearts and minds of those closest to us.\n \nJoin us for Camp Cour
 age\, an intensive training on how to talk to our legislators\, friends\, f
 amily and community members about the importance of equality through our ow
 n stories and experiences. Based on the model developed by the Courage Camp
 aign\, these trainings across New Hampshire will empower individuals to hav
 e "Courageous Conversations" about their personal reasons for supporting ma
 rriage equality. Working in local teams\, we will establish ways to strengt
 hen equality in our community\, at the State House and one person at a time
 .\n \nTo sign-up or help organize a Camp Courage in your area\, visit http:
 //granitestatecampcourage.org/.\n \n \n***\nAbout Monadnock Live Free and E
 qual Coalition\nCore organizers invited community members to attend an orga
 nizational meeting on January 6 and were delighted when 31 people made the 
 commitment!  Work groups were formed and initial assignments made.  The Jan
 uary 22 training represents Phase II of the effort dedicated to ensuring th
 at marriage equality for NH’s gay and lesbian citizens remains intact.  Tim
 e is short\, so there can be no delay.  We need you NOW!  Join us on Facebo
 ok at http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_131783710217502\n \nAbout G
 ranite State Progress\nGranite State Progress is a progressive advocacy org
 anization that addresses issues of immediate state and local concern. Grani
 te State Progress ran the successful Challenge the Vote to Discriminate pub
 lic education campaign during the 2010 town meeting season\, which resoundi
 ngly rejected anti-gay attempts to discriminate against same-sex couples.\n
  \nAbout the Courage Campaign\nThe Courage Campaign Institute is part of th
 e Courage Campaign's online organizing network that empowers more than 700\
 ,000 grassroots and netroots activists to push for progressive change and f
 ull equality in California and across the country. The Courage Campaign org
 anized the Prop 8 Trial Tracker documenting the historic court case in Cali
 fornia and has conducted numerous Courage Camps to build “a grassroots army
  for equality”.

DESCRIPTION:After a summer hiatus\, we are regrouping for a September meeti
 ng.  We will be reading The Wordy Shipmates\, by Sarah Vowell.  It's an amu
 sing look at the Puritans and how they still influence us today.  We are go
 ing to meet on Wednesday\, September 23\, 6:30 PM at the Food Court at Colo
 ny Mill Marketplace. \n \nI hope you are all having a good summer and I loo
 k forward to seeing you in September.\n \nLinda Cates\n \nFrom Publishers W
 eekly\nEssayist and public radio regular Vowell  revisits America's Puritan
  roots in this witty exploration of the ways in which our country's present
  predicaments are inextricably tied to its past. In a style less colloquial
  than her previous books\, Vowell traces the 1630 journey of several key En
 glish colonists and members of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Foremost among
  these men was John Winthrop\, who would become governor of Massachusetts. 
 While the Puritans who had earlier sailed to Plymouth on the Mayflower were
  separatists\, Winthrop's followers remained loyal to England\, spurred on 
 by Puritan Reverend John Cotton's proclamation that they were God's chosen 
 people. Vowell underscores that the seemingly minute differences between th
 e Plymouth Puritans and the Massachusetts Puritans were as meaningful as th
 e current Sunni/Shia Muslim rift. Gracefully interspersing her history less
 on with personal anecdotes\, Vowell offers reflections that are both amusin
 g  and tender .

DESCRIPTION:Book Group\n\nWe had a good meeting Wednesday night\, ten peopl
 e and an excellent discussion of Hot\, Flat and Crowded by Thomas Freidman.
  This book should be required reading. The first half will scare you to dea
 th\, but the second half will give you some hope\, and some ideas of what w
 e can do to save the planet - and our economy. Phil mentioned that he found
  online\, an 84 minute lecture by Freidman on Hot\, Flat and Crowded. So if
  you don’t have time to read the book\, perhaps you can go online and watch
  the lecture. During our discussion we wondered what kind of “green” steps 
 are being taken by the State of New Hampshire. We wished that Suzanne was t
 here to enlighten us. Kay is going to check with her and see what she can f
 ind out to report at our next meeting.\n\nWe are not meeting in December du
 e to everyone’s busy schedule.\n\nWe thought it would be interesting to rea
 d one of the books that Obama is reading in preparation for the presidency.
  So\, for January we are going to read The Defining Moment: FDR’s Hundred D
 ays and the Triumph of Hope\, by Jonathan Alter. This is the book that Obam
 a mentioned during his 60 Minutes interview. We will meet on Wednesday\, Ja
 nuary 14\, 6:30 PM in the Food Court at Colony Mill Marketplace.\n\nFor Feb
 ruary\, we will be reading American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House
 \, by Jon Meacham. For March\, we are considering The Devil’s Highway: A Tr
 ue Story\, by Luis Alberto Urrea\, about illegal immigration\, a subject we
 ’ve been meaning to get to.

DESCRIPTION:Chesterfield Democratic Committee\nNOV. 1ST & 2ND: Literature d
 rop\n\nELECTION DAY : Poll watchers\, visibility\, rides to the polls\, com
 munications\n\nFor the details:\nDuring the days of Nov. 1\, 2\, 3\, and 4\
 , we need all the volunteers we can get\, to make telephone calls\, enter d
 ata\, put literature on every doorstep\, make food\, house out-of-town volu
 nteers\, poll watch\, hold signs\, etc. We are particularly interested if y
 ou have Voting Day - November 4 - free to work all day. This meeting will b
 e our chance to coordinate everyone in Chesterfield\, Hinsdale and Winchest
 er.\n\nSIGNS: There are still some people who ordered OBAMA signs and I hav
 en’t been able to deliver them. Please contact me again\, or stop by and pi
 ck them up. Also\, we have some extras\, and if you want one in front of yo
 ur house\, let me know.\n\nNOV. 1 & 2 LITERATURE DROP. On Saturday and Sund
 ay\, we want to deliver a couple of pieces of paper to every doorstep in Ch
 esterfield. I like to do this very early\, before people are up\, so I don’
 t get stuck chatting\, but it can really go on all day. This is not a canva
 ss - no need to talk\, just drop the information off.\nWe could really use 
 a lot of people\, even if you only want to do your street.\n\nELECTION DAY:
  I’ll be spending most of the day outside the polls (Chesterfield Town Hall
 ) \, holding signs\, chatting and passing out literature to anyone who want
 s it\, and I’d love company(It looks a lot better if there is a group.)\n\n
 Kathy Thatcher is opening her house as the local headquarters\, and we need
  staff and food help there. We need people to make phone calls. All these j
 obs can be done in shifts\, so you don’t have to commit the whole day. But\
 , if anyone thinks they have the whole day - or even half the day - to help
 \, please get in touch with me for other activities.\n\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH
  FOR ALL THE SUPPORT AND GOOD WILL YOU HAVE SHOWN IN THE PAST. AS YOU KNOW\
 , THIS IS THE FINAL MOMENT\, A HISTORIC \, TRANSFORMATIONAL\,\, DEFINING MO
 MENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WORK FOR HOPE AND GOOD GOVERNMENT THESE FINAL WEE
 KS\, AND TELL YOU GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT IT!

 ur house\, let me know.\n\nNOV. 1 & 2 LITERATURE DROP. On Saturday and Sund
 ay\, we want to deliver a couple of pieces of paper to every doorstep in Ch
 esterfield. I like to do this very early\, before people are up\, so I don’

 ss - no need to talk\, just drop the information off.\nWe could really use 
 a lot of people\, even if you only want to do your street.\n\nELECTION DAY:
  I’ll be spending most of the day outside the polls (Chesterfield Town Hall

 orm Committee. The platform committee is trying to get as many people to co
 me their hearings and propose ideas as possible and in order to help you pr
 epare I have included the Platform procedures in the body of this email.\n 
 \n2008 Platform Process\n \nThe Platform Committee of the New Hampshire Dem
 ocratic Party has created the following procedure to bring forth ideas for 
 the 2008 Party Platform.  The Committee will hold hearings around New Hamps
 hire to gather possible planks from as many Democrats as possible.  The Com
 mittee will then draft a Platform\, which will then be voted on at the Stat
 e Convention in May.  Below are the scheduled dates and locations for Platf
 orm Committee Hearings.  Procedures for proposing amendments to the Platfor
 m will follow.\n \nI.  Hearing Procedure\nadopted by the Platform Committee
  February 13\, 2008\n \n \n1.             Democrats are invited to attend o
 pen hearings around the state to provide representatives of the Platform Co
 mmittee with comments on what the Platform should include.  The 2006 Platfo
 rm is available on the State Party website for reference and will be availa
 ble at hearings.\n \n2.             Proposed planks must address State of N
 ew Hampshire matters.  National matters will be referred to the Resolutions
  Committee of the State Convention.\n \n3.             The Committee reques
 ts that any proposed planks be in writing\, one plank per page\, so that it
  may give all plank ideas careful consideration during the drafting stage.\
 n \n4.             The following is a sketch of broad themes and planks the
  platform might include which are meant to promote thought and discussion. 
  This list is not final or all-inclusive and is provided as an outline of p
 ossible topics Democrats may want the Platform to address.\n \n \nPossible 
 Themes and Planks\n \n \n1. Strong Families\n§  Education\n§  Healthcare\n§
   Childcare\n§  Housing\n§  Retirement Security\n \n2. Strong Economy\n§  J
 obs\n§  Diversification\n§  Rural Development\n§  Business Investment\n \n3

 c Safety\n§  Environment\n \n4. Live Free or Die Tradition\n§  Civil Rights

DESCRIPTION: Cheshire County Democrats Book Club\n\nFor November\, we are r
 eading Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\, by Alexandra Fuller. It's a mem
 oir of a childhood in apartheid Africa. We will meet on Tuesday\, November 
 13\, at 6:30 PM\, in the Green room at the Keene Public Library.\n\nWe hope
  you can join us.\n\nLinda\n\nFrom Publishers WeeklyA classic is born in th
 is tender\, intensely moving and even delightful journey through a white Af
 rican girl's childhood. Fuller was conceived and bred on African soil durin
 g the Rhodesian civil war (1971-1979)\, a world where children over five "l
 earn how to load an FN rifle magazine\, strip and clean all the guns in the
  house\, and ultimately\, shoot-to-kill." With a unique and subtle sensitiv
 ity to racial issues\, Fuller describes her parents' racism and the wartime
  relationships between blacks and whites through a child's watchful eyes. C
 urfews and war\, mosquitoes\, land mines\, ambushes and "an abundance of le
 opards" are the stuff of this childhood. "Dad has to go out into the bush..
 . and find terrorists and fight them"\; Mum saves the family from an Egypti
 an spitting cobra\; they both fight "to keep one country in Africa white-ru
 n." The "A" schools ("with the best teachers and facilities") are for white
  children\; "B" schools serve "children who are neither black nor white"\; 
 and "C" schools are for black children. Fuller's world is marked by sudden\
 , drastic changes: the farm is taken away for "land redistribution"\; one t
 erm at school\, five white students are "left in the boarding house... amon
 g two hundred African students"\; three of her four siblings die in infancy
 \; the family constantly sets up house in hostile\, desolate environments a
 s they move from Rhodesia to Zambia to Malawi and back to Zambia. But Fulle
 r's remarkable affection for her parents (who are racists) and her homeland
  (brutal under white and black rule) shines through. This affection\, in sp
 ite of its subjects' prominent flaws\, reveals their humanity and allows th
 e reader direct entry into her world. Fuller's book has the promise of bein
 g widely read and remaining of interest for years to come.
